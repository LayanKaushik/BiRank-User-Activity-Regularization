# BiRank-User-Activity-Regularization

This repository contains code and presentation materials for addressing User Activity Biases in Bipartite Graph Ranking using the BiRank Algorithm. The approach focuses on the regularization of relative user activity based on the degree of the node. This work is part of the Duke 521 Graph Matrix Analysis Class.
